# Home markdown 
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com) 

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

```javascript
function test() {
 console.log("look maâ€™, no spaces");
}
```
